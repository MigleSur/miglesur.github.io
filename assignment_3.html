    <ul>
        <li> It was chosen to simplify the tree and not include the partners of Trump's children. </li>
        <li> The colors were chosen to show how much of Donald Trump's blood the person has.
        This results in Donald Trump shown as very dark red, all his wives as blue (i.e. no genetic relation to Donald Trump),
        His children are lighter red as they have only 50% of Donald's genes and grandchildren pink - 25% of
        Donald's genes. </li>
        <li> Style of edges is different for each marriage of Donald Trump. Different styles of
        edges make it very easy to see how many children and grandchildren Donald Trump has from each marriage. </li>
        <li> In genetics it is accepted to mark males as squares and females as circles. In order to make it easier to
        understand how many sons/grandsons and daughters/granddaughters Donald Trump has all the individuals in the family
        tree were marked according to the gender (males - square, females - circle). </li>
        <li> Interactivity in this plot is limited to showing the pictures of Donald Trump and his wives when the mouse is
        pointing at them. It could be expanded to all the family members. Also, it would be useful to be able to click on
        the chosen family member and get a short description about him/her. </li>
