<div>The list with links to interactive visualizations:</div>
<ol>
    
    <li> <h2><a href="https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/all">Meteor showers visualization</a></h2>
   <p> <span style="color:green">Good:</span>Very intuitive and easy to interact with.
       The fact that the visualization reflects how the data looks like by mirroring
       or simulating reality, instead of resorting to abstract plots representations,
       makes grabbing its insights straightforward.</p>
   <p> <span style="color:red">Improvable:</span>The view mode "Watch from Earth" is a bit confusing to the eye.</p>
     
    <li> <h2><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles">The Gapminder project</a></h2>
   <p> <span style="color:green">Good:</span>Extremely comprehensive visualizations on several human
       development indicators for all countries in the world for more than a hundred years in some cases.
       The visualizations are also very intuitive to understand and fun to watch. The data displayed on
       them can be easily filtered. For example, one can select a specific set of countries</p>
   <p> <span style="color:red">Improvable:</span>Contrary to the first visualization, it is very plot
       based and there are no visualizations where one can actually look at the data in such a direct way.</p>
