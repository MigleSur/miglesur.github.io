    <li> <h2><a href="https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/all">Meteor showers visualization</a></h2>
   <p> <span style="color:green">Good:</span>Very intuitive and easy to interact with.
       The fact that the visualization reflects how the data looks like by mirroring
       or simulating reality, instead of resorting to abstract plots representations,
       makes grabbing its insights straightforward.</p>
   <p> <span style="color:red">Improvable:</span>The view modes "Watch from Earth" and
       "Follow the Earth" are a bit confusing to the eye.</p>
     
    <li> <h2><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles">The Gapminder project</a></h2>
   <p> <span style="color:green">Good:</span>Extremely comprehensive visualizations on several human
       development indicators for all countries in the world for more than a hundred years in some cases.
       The visualizations are also very intuitive to understand and fun to watch. The data displayed on
       them can be easily filtered. For example, one can select a specific set of countries or pause the
       plot to analyze it more deeply.</p>
   <p> <span style="color:red">Improvable:</span>Contrary to the first visualization, it is very plot
       based and there are no visualizations where one can actually look at the data in such a direct way.</p>

<h3>Miglė</h3>

    I would like to be able visualize the sequencing data and make it look easy to understand.
    It becomes extremely challenging when there is a need to nicely visualize the whole human genome,
    or even more complicated - many genomes. I would get access to the data which is freely accessible.
    I would like to show the differences between the genomes and their relationship with each other.
    Scientists would be the main audience, but not necessarily specialized in that specific area.

<h3>Antonio</h3>

    I would like to be able to visualize protein structure and sequence data for my Masther Thesis in Novozymes.
    They have several databases which can be further analyzed to provide useful insights through visualizations.
    The current workflow requires a lot of manual work that could be automated by means of such a tool.
    For example, generating a document for a specific analysis report requires accessing several databases by hand.
    All of this could be automated and standardized. The intended audience of this tool would be Novozymes technicians.
