    <h3>
        How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?
    </h3>

    <div>The plot shows mean yearly temperature in two cities: Kaunas (Lithuania) and Madrid (Spain).
        <br>The plot was made by adapting the template provided by
        <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245">bl.ocks.org</a>. </div>
    <div>The data was prepared with R, the script which was used is <a href="data_mean_temp.R">here</a>.</div>
    <p>
        Two data sets were used for visualizations with the same time interval (1953-2015) for both cities
        (such short time period was used because the bigger data set was not available for Madrid).
        For the first plot the last column of the data sets was used as it shows the mean yearly temperature.
        The line plot shows how the mean yearly temperature changed since 1953 in Madrid and Kaunas. The global
        average is shown by the horizontal red lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        One could hypothesize that the mean yearly temperature is increasing because of the global warming in both cities.
        However the conclusion can not be drawn without a statistical test. After performing a Mann-Kendall non-parametric
        test (code is present in R script) for positive changes over time, in both cases we got p-values lower than 0.05
        (for Kaunas < 10e-6, for Madrid < 10e-3) and so we can conclude that the mean yearly temperature in both cities
        is increasing over time.
    </p>

    <p>It is remarkable to notice that the coldest city (Kaunas) is the one showing the strongest increasing trend.</p>

    <div> The plot shows the mean temperature for each month in two cities: Kaunas (Lithuania) and Madrid (Spain).</div>
    <div> The data was prepared with R, the script which was used is <a href="data_mean_month.R">here</a>. </div>

    <!--<p>-->
        <!--As in the first plot it is obvious that the temperature is always lower in Lithuania compared with Spain.-->
        <!--This information can be useful for people looking for holiday destinations.-->
    <!--</p>-->
    <p>
        Both cities follow the same trend: winter time is colder than the summer time. Also, it is interesting that
        the temperature difference between Kaunas and Madrid is highest in the winter but is way smaller in spring.
        This reveals that Kaunas temperature increase through the year is bigger than in Madrid, and thus explains
        the finding from the line plot: colder cities are possibly more sensitive to global warming.

        <li>
            Which data set (that is realistically possible for you to obtain) and visualization would you include to <br> give
            a more confident answer to the articles main question?
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MiglÄ—:</strong> As the question is about the weather change, not only temperature, but also wind, rain <br>
            data sets could be used to answer the question. Also, the data sets from nearby cities could allow to see a better <br>
                picture of the chosen area. As temperature in the city and outside the city normally differs, it could be useful <br>
                to use data sets from nearby places outside the city. As for visualizations, the whole Europe's map could be used <br>
                to show the changes over time as an interactive, animated map.
            </li>

        <li>
            So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve <br> your article?
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antonio:</strong> Animating the aesthetic elements over time would provide a more direct way to see the <br>
                evolution of the weather, similar to what the Gapminder project shows with socieconomic factors. <br>
                Basic interactive properties, such as mouse hover, time range selection, or zooming would give <br>
                users access to specific weather measurements and further customize the data exploration <br>
                experience.
