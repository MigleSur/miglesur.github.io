    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Principal component analysis (PCA) is a very popular technique for dimensionality reduction.
        It is extremely useful for visualizing high dimensionality data in 2 dimensions while keeping
        as much variance (information) as possible. Performing PCA essentially brings the data to a new set of dimensions (principal components, PC)
        each capturing as much variance as possible. Therefore, the first PCs capture most of the variance in the data set.
        PCA can be carried out by running singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix or by eigenvalue
        decomposition of the covariance matrix. More information about PCA can be found
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The given data set consists of 56 pairs of x,y coordinates of hand points making up a detailed contour of their shape.
        As it is very impractical to plot all 40 hands in order to analyze them and draw conclusions, a PCA comes very handy in this
        high dimensional (56*2 total dimensions) dataset. Most variance is captured in the first PCs, and thus we will focus on them in the following discussion.
    </p>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>
        In the visualization above, a number of interactive elements are introduced to improve the quality of the visualization.
        Hovering on a chosen data point in the PCA plot, a text label shows which hand in the data set it
        is (hand id or row number). Furthermore, clicking the same point in the PCA plot triggers the representation of the corresponding hand.
        Furthermore, it is possible to choose which principal components are plotted, so not only
        PC1 and PC2 can be investigated. Unsurprisingly, the PC span is greatest in the first, and becomes smaller as the PC id grows.
        The slider under the plot makes it easier to investigate what trend each principal component captures.
        <!--Clustering makes easier to identify the main hand contour clusters and draw conclusions from that.  -->
    </p>
    <h3>Results and discussion</h3>
    <p>
        From the PCA plot of PC1 and PC2 it is easy to see (especially by using a slider to investigate PCs) that PC1 shows
        how spread the fingers are and PC2 shows which fingers are closer to each other (the little finger or the index finger is
        closer to the ring finger and the middle finger). In order to investigate it a little bit more see the difference
        between the most extreme datapoints in each PC.
        <!--Clustering lets us investigate which hands are most similar to each other especially using high k values it is easy to -->
        <!--see the most similar hands.-->
